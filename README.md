Task 1
    
    Function: This is a simple Python program that takes a number from the user and tells whether it's even or odd.

    Working:
        1. Prompts the user to enter a number.
        2. Converts the input to an integer.
        3. Checks if the number is divisible by 2:
            - If yes, it’s even.
            - If not, it’s odd.
        4. Displays the result.

Task 2

    Function: This is a simple python code that performs addition of first 50 natural numbers 

    Worrking:
        1. Initialises the variable 'sum' to 0.
        2. Initiates 'for loop' using range function starting from 1.
        3. The iteration variable hols the values of the natural integers hence adds them to the variable 'sum' and stores them in the same variable basically updating it every iteration.
        4. The loop iterates 50 times and then prints final required sum.
